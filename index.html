            <h1>Marceline's Fry Song</h1>
            <p>Daddy, why did you eat my fries?<br>
                I bought them, and they were mine.<br>
                But you ate them, yeah, you ate my fries...<br>
                And I cried, but you didn't see me cry.</p>
            <p>Daddy,
                Do you even love me?<br>
                Well, I wish you'd show it,<br>
                'Cause I wouldn't know it.</p>
            <p>What kind of dad eats his daughter's fries,<br>
                And doesn't even look her in the eyes?<br>
                Daddy, there were tears there.<br>
                If you saw them would you even care?</p>
